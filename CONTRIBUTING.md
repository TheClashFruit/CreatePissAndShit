## Stuff To Know Before Contributing

### Proposing a Feature

If you want to submit a new feature please don't open a pull request directly, open up an issue first for discussion, you can build your feature as the discussion and after the issue came to a conclusion and your feature was "approved" you can open up your pull request.

### Commit Messages

Please try to follow the repo's commit style if you plan on contributing. This helps to make the repo a bit more organised.

* Explain what the commit does or what did you do in the commit message with less than 50 characters.
* Use the commit description if you can't fit what you did in the commit message.
* Use one of these prefixes in your commit messages:
  * `fix:` When you fixed a bug or maybe a flaw within the codebase.
  * `feat:` When you added something within the codebase (can be anything).
  * `tweak:` When you do a little tweak in the codebase, like a tiny texture change.
  * `chore:` When you do fixed something, but it doesn't affect the mod in terms of functionality.
  * `refactor:` When you refactored the code, like cleaning up the code.
  * `docs:` When you changed the documentation, like the README.md file.

### Adding Yourself to the Credits

Please only add yourself to the credits in `fabric.mod.json` when your contribution is more significant to the project like fixing a bug or adding a feature.
